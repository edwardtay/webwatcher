Backend API lives in repo root. /frontend is a separate client that talks to the API over HTTP, never by importing backend code.

Localhost and live site must behave the same: no sneaky mocks, no stunt doubles. Same inputs, same outputs.

Ports: avoid port turf wars. Backend uses PORT from env, frontend uses its own env port. Both must run together without conflict. Never hardcode ports. If a port is busy on Linux:
fuser -k PORT/tcp
or just pick a new PORT via env.

Multi agent rule: never forget previous edits. Always read the latest file from disk before modifying. No time travel, no reverts from stale memory. Changes must stack cleanly.

All guides, fixes, and test notes belong in /private, not inside production code.

When in doubt: keep architecture clean, keep changes incremental, and keep localhost behaving exactly like live.
