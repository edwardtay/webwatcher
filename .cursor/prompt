Backend API lives in repo root. /frontend is a separate client that only calls the API over HTTP. Never mix backend code into frontend or vice versa.

Localhost port conflicts: never hardcode ports. Use env var PORT. If port is busy on Linux, quick fix:
fuser -k PORT/tcp

Multi-agent rule: never forget previous edits. Always read the latest file content before modifying. Never revert or recreate files based on old assumptions. Changes must be cumulative and consistent.

All guides, fixes, and test notes go in /private, not inside production code.
